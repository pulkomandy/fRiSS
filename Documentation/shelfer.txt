shelfer Ver. 1.2


Introduction

After crashing Tracker more than five times in a row, I decided that it's much easier to code if your desktop and windows stays alive. Thus "shelfer" was born.


Usage

Run it. Drag your view into the window by using your view's BDragger handle. If everything goes right, it will show up there. If you don't believe me, test it with the Clock application ;-)
Note that shelfer won't save its content so don't worry that a messy replicant shows up next time you start shelfer.
NOTE: due to some caching and buffering and other nasty stuff, you better close and restart shelfer each time you have tested your app. Just to be sure you really get to see the final version of your replicant. I once debugged the damn app for some time just to find out that the replicant was of an older version of the app :-(


Background Information

The name? Basically it's just a combination of BShelf and Helfer which is German for helper. No big deal.
Programmed June 17th 2004, after midnight until 2 o'clock.

History

Ver 1.2: SetDisplaysZombies and SetAllowsZombies set to true
Ver 1.1: now saves its position
